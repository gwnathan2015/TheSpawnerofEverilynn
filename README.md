## PA-1.6

while underappreciated now, PA-1.6 was a complete breakthrough, instead of doing nested Lua tables like this:

    game_map2 = {
        { { u = { GREEN }, o = { TREE_U } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { GREEN } } },
        { { u = { GREEN, TREE_L } },         { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } },    { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { FLOWERS } } },
        { { u = { FLOWERS } },               { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } } },
        { { u = { GREEN } },                 { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } },    { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } } },
        { { u = { FLOWERS } },               { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } , o = {TREE_U}} },
        { { u = { PATH } },                  { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { GREEN, TREE_L } } },
        { { u = { PATH } },                  { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } } },
        { { u = { PATH } },                  { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },    { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { PATH } } },
        { { u = { PATH } },                  { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } } },
        { { u = { PATH }, o = {TREE_U} },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } } },
        { { u = { GREEN, TREE_L } },         { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },    { u = { GREEN } },   { u = { FLOWERS } }, { u = { PATH } },   { u = { FLOWERS } } }
    }

we just decided to turn it to JSON! we added three files, mapreader.lua, the most important, uses a Json loading library thingy to load the Json map/maps, map1.json, the 2nd most important one, is the map itself, now using a structure saner like "|GF  |G  |GF" instead of the chaos from before. the other file, map.lua barely does anything other than add bushes, an entity-like object drawn over the player.

## Features
 
nothing much to see here, most features aren't here yet, although there is a wizard (supposed to sell potions when the game is done), a swordsman (follows the player and supposed to help the player defeat dwarves) and a working movement system where the bottom half of trees and NPCs can't be moved into. to see future game updates go into version.md.
we got some nice music (that doesn't play in game yet) from the web. for more info about that go to the credits md file in the music folder.
press R to respawn if you ever need that. also pressing ESC closes the game

## PLANNED MODDING
mods will look like this:
```
mods/
    dwarven_expansion_mod/
        dwarven_expansion_mod info.lua
        assets/
            tiles/
            characters/
            items/
            ui/
        code/
            maps/
                dwarven_expansion_mod map1.lua
                dwarven_expansion_mod map2.lua
            hazards.lua
            npcs.lua
            items.lua
            init.lua
```
the info.lua file for each mod will say basic info like:
```
return {
    name = "Dwarven Expansion Mod",
    version = "1.0",
    author = "Nathan",
    description = "Adds dwarven ruins, new hazards, and expanded lore.",
    mod_type = "addition", -- content + features
    entry = "code/init.lua",
    assets = {
        tiles = "assets/tiles/",
        characters = "assets/characters/",
        items = "assets/items/",
        ui = "assets/ui/"
        music = "assets/music"
        sounds = "assets/sounds"
    },
    dependencies = {},
    load_priority = 1
}
```
In the future, when modding can be implemented (maybe it will), mods will follow a specific folder structure. Each mod will live inside the “mods” directory. A typical mod folder will contain an info file, an assets folder, and a code folder. The assets folder will contain tiles, characters, items, UI elements, music, and sounds. The code folder will contain maps, hazards, NPC definitions, item definitions, and an init.lua file that acts as the mod’s entry point.

The info.lua file inside each mod will contain metadata describing the mod. This metadata includes the mod’s name, version, author, description, mod type, entry point, asset directory paths, dependencies, and load priority. The mod_type field determines what kind of mod it is. The entry field tells the game which file to execute first. The assets field lists the directories where the mod’s assets are stored. The dependencies field lists other mods required for this mod to function. The load_priority field determines the order in which mods are loaded.

The init.lua file must explicitly tell the game where every file in the code folder is located. Modders can organize their code folder however they want, but init.lua must reference each file so the game can load it. Map files must include the mod’s name in their filename, with spaces replaced by underscores. The assets folder must follow the exact structure described above, or the game will not load the assets correctly, resulting in broken maps or missing content.

There are three planned types of mods. Content mods only add maps using either vanilla tiles or tiles added by other mods. Content mods do not require an assets folder, but they still follow the same overall structure. Addition mods include everything shown in the full mod structure. They add maps, tiles, characters, items, hazards, UI elements, music, sounds, and other content. Feature mods do not add maps or tiles. Instead, they add new gameplay systems, mechanics, or engine-level features. Feature mods can also act as compatibility layers or API cores that help other mods function, similar to how Minecraft modding frameworks work.

This entire modding system is theoretical and will require significant rewriting of the game engine. It is planned for PA-1.9.4

## LORE AND STORY

in 234 CE of the planet of everliynn, a lone dwarf stumbles upon the "spawner" and he uses its full potential to corrupt and bend the kingdom of Evely to his will, soon he destroyed it, building the castle fort city of dwarvia to replace it.

in 245 CE of the planet everliynn, the lone dwarf declares the empire of dwarvenland. many nearby kingdoms fall to his imperial forces, as he plumages the world

now, in 256 CE of the planet Everilynn, you alone can plan and manage to defeat the dwarven king, starting from the last free, big city, fort city, you must free the world of the dwarven empire, and you are not alone in your fights, you have the wizard, who will gladly sell you your potions in return for coins gained by defeating dwarves, the farmer, who will gladly sell you food to heal your health after a great fight with dwarves, and your most loyal ally, the swordsman, who pledged to protect and help you in combat. the reason for this is unknown, and what the spawner is unknown, however the swordsman says that he thinks is an amalgamation of the mythical "creator of the world's powers after he is said to have been tricked into losing his powers by a small group of kings, seeking power for themselves, however the power never managed to get to those kings, and eventually over time became deep in the earth and compacted into the spawner, only for it to be found by that lone dwarf when he was mining.

the goals and intent of the dwarf remain unknown, except for one thing that an elven spy in the dwarven court said, he said "the dwarven king said 'KILL THEM ALL, THE ELVES, THE HUMANS, THE ANIMALS, KILL THEM, ALL, GIVE ME ALL THEIR WEALTH, AND GROW OUR POPULATION! SOON WE Shall MARCH ON FORT CITY" ever since then, fort city and everless have been getting attacked, and while fort city created an elaborate wall and canal thing, everless grew a large barrier of trees, stone, dirt, grass, and water

fort city and everless are very different, first of all everless is the last remaining major elven settlement, its more down to earth, and many houses are made out of large mushrooms or trees(typical in where they live) and their defense systems against dwarves use grasses and mosses that are poisonous to dwarves but not humans, the two cities are far apart, but they both jointly protect the trade between each other, sending military with traders to protect them and make sure the trade gets to the other side of the trade corridor

the player starts with 100 HP the swordsman has 120, but he got hurt on his way to the player at the start, and the wizard and farmer have 100, the basic dwarves have 50, the bulk dwarves have 100, the miner dwarves have 120, and the dwarf golems have 350. the commanders have 90 but cannot defend themselves except for spawning in dwarves.
getting rid of special dwarves lessens the dwarves supply of them, as they are very hard to create, taking years after the empire's formation for the first golem to be finished.

when the final boss fight is ahead, beware the dwarves are tricky to fight, they will spend years trying to get rid of you, especially if they're at their weakest, which is when you're at your weakest, underestimating them. beware, every turn could bring a dwarven attack, every battle, loses food, health, and potions, and every escape, loses morale. and another beware, the dwarves can NOT be reasoned with.

the farmer sells bread, gives 20 HP, apples gives 10 HP, wheat, give it to the miller and get a portable milling station, potatoes gives 65 HP. 1 bread is usually worth 2 or 3 coins, while 1 apple is usually worth 1, and wheat is free (for a quest) when it's not its usually 2 coins, 1 potato sits at 3 or 4 coins.

one quest has the player protecting a trade caravan to the elven city of everless, only right after during your overnight stay, you hear dwarf noises, you have to protect the city from a dwarven invasion.

the humans and elves used to live in one kingdom, the two kingdoms royal heritage united, but the dwarves once took the trade corridor, and the two have not reunified since. beware, the weakest point is also the most attacked, because the weakest point.... is the most important one. the wizard has used some of his magic to put fort city in a pocket universe to protect it from full dwarven occupation, as dwarves can't stay in there for long.

everless is in a ring of magic, a magical barrier created in 1206 BCE by elven wizards' magicians and elders to defend the city before the unification with the humans in 119 CE. the crown prince of everless is the heir to the crown, and soon to be leader, as the current king is in deteriorating condition. the princess of everless was married to prince mark of Marell (a small human-elven settlement off the coast of the great ocean) and was previously before that married to prince browom of the city right next to fort city, fortress city.

the great ocean is being drained by the dwarves, its already half its usual size, where all this water goes is unknown, however legends say its the king of dwarveia practicing ice freezing, and throwing. the reigion of marell is larger than the used to exist town, but you see... the area has grown due to the great oceans no longer being great.

the miller offers you a portable milling station, in return for you transporting from the farmer to the miller. with it, you can turn wheat into flour, flour into dough, and dough into any type of bread you can make. the weaponsmith, offers you axes, swords, pickaxes (for if you need stone to repair portable stations), and the guard of the towers, offers you arrows, and a portable fletching station.

typical tools include stone iron and bronze swords axes and arrows, with wooden silk bows, the silk coming from silk trees in everless, currently the massive iron and bronze fields are in dwarven territory. one quest is to reclaim it. afetr the quest, the price of iron and iron tools goes from 50 coins to 15 coins. same with bronze going from 35 coins to 10 coins. arrows on both types go from around 20 to only 8 coins.

the king of fort city and the crown prince of everless (current acting king) offer you 30 coins each for reclaiming the reigion and setting up fortifications.
